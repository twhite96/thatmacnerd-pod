description: Yes. I am podcasting again but not about programming
---

I have been in the podcast game for a couple years now, on and off, with a show about programming. It was just me, then my co-host and iOS dev [Nick Lash](http://soundsmitten.com/). Our podcast was called *This Developer's Journey*. It was fun but Nick got laid off and I was in school so the podcast got put on hiatus[^1].

Earlier this year I created a podcast called [DevBytes](https://devbytes.tech/) but I had no idea how to run a developer podcast by myself. [David Smith](https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith) did it for years before he teamed up with [Marco Arment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment) for [Under the Radar](https://overcast.fm/itunes1055685246/under-the-radar). I don't have the persistence or charisma that David has to pull such a feat off. I also don't have 10+ years experience in this field.

Nick and I originally wanted to do an Apple-centric podcast but I already had This Developer's Journey so we went with that.

## Trying Again
Now that I am not doing this for career purposes, I think this will be a fun venture without a whole lot of commitment. Hope you give it a listen and let me know what you think and how to improve it.


[^1]: It was doomed. I just hate editing long podcasts.
