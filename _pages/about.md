I'm Tiffany, a Mac Nerd who writes articles on Apple, musings on personal things and observations, and productivity.

This is a site for my podcast, a companion to my main Apple commentary over on [That Mac Nerd](https://thatmacnerd.com). I don't record as often as I'd like as I am still figuring this thing out. But for now, this is where you can find the episodes.

If you want, you can find my scribblings on programming at [Tiffany R. White Blog](https://tiffanywhite.dev).If youâ€™re also of the programming persuasion, you can find me as [TiffanyW_412](https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412) on Twitter.
